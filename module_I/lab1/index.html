        <p><b>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.</b></p>

        <p><strong>Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,</strong> </p>

        <p><i>when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.</i></p>

        <p><em>has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.</em> </p>
        
        <p><mark>It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
        and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</mark></p>
